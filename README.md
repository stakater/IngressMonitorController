# ![](assets/web/IMC-round-100px.png) Ingress Monitor Controller

A Kubernetes controller to watch ingresses and create liveness alerts for your apps/microservices in Uptime checkers.

[![Get started with Stakater](https://stakater.github.io/README/stakater-github-banner.png)](http://stakater.com/?utm_source=IngressMonitorController&utm_medium=github)

## Problem Statement

We want to monitor ingresses in a kubernetes cluster via any uptime checker but the problem is having to manually check
 for new ingresses / removed ingresses and add them to the checker or remove them.

## Solution

This controller will continuously watch ingresses in specific or all namespaces, and automatically add / remove monitors
 in any of the uptime checkers. With the help of this solution, you can keep a check on your services and see whether
  they're up and running and live, without worrying about manually registering them on the Uptime checker.

## Supported Uptime Checkers

Currently we support the following monitors:

- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com)
- [Pingdom](https://pingdom.com) ([Additional Config](docs/pingdom-configuration.md))
- [StatusCake](https://www.statuscake.com) ([Additional Config](docs/statuscake-configuration.md))

## Usage

The following quickstart let's you set up Ingress Monitor Controller to register uptime monitors for ingresses in all namespaces:

1. Download the
 [manifest file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/IngressMonitorController/master/deployments/kubernetes/ingressmonitorcontroller.yaml)

2. Open the downloaded file in a text editor. Configure the uptime checker in the `config.yaml` data for the ConfigMap resource, and set the following properties

    | Key           | Description                                                               |
    |---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | name          | Name of the provider (e.g. UptimeRobot)                                   |
    | apiKey        | ApiKey of the provider                                                    |
    | apiURL        | Base url of the ApiProvider                                               |
    | alertContacts | A `-` separated list of contact id's that you want to add to the monitors |

    *Note:* Follow [this](docs/uptimerobot-configuration.md) guide to see how to fetch `alertContacts` from UptimeRobot.

3. Enable for your Ingress

   You will need to add the following annotation on your ingresses so that the controller is able to recognize and monitor it.

   ```yaml
   "monitor.stakater.com/enabled": "true"
   ```
4. Deploy the controller by running the following kubectl command:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ingressmonitorcontroller.yaml -n default
   ```
