# Ingress Monitor Controller

[![Get started with Stakater](https://stakater.github.io/README/stakater-github-banner.png)](http://stakater.com/?utm_source=IngressMonitorController&utm_medium=github)

## Problem Statement

How do I get notified if any of my services is down?

We want to get notified in a slack channel & email if any of our services become unhealthy!

We want to monitor ingresses in a kubernetes cluster via any uptime checker but the problem is to manually check for new ingresses / removed ingresses and add them to the checker or remove them. There isn't any out of the box solution for this as of now.

## Solution

This controller will continuously watch ingresses in the namespace it is running, and automatically add / remove monitors in any of the uptime checkers. With the help of this solution, you can keep a check on your services and see whether they're up and running and live.

## Supported Uptime Checkers

Currently we support the following monitors:

- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com)

- [Pingdom](https://pingdom.com)

## Deploying to Kubernetes

### Vanilla Manifests

You have to first clone or download the repository contents. The kubernetes deployment and files are provided inside `kubernetes/manifests` folder.

#### Enabling

By default, the controller ignores the ingresses without a specific annotation on it. You will need to add the following annotation on your ingresses so that the controller is able to recognize and monitor the ingresses.

```yaml
"monitor.stakater.com/enabled": "true"
```

The annotation key is `monitor.stakater.com/enabled` and you can toggle the value of this annotation between `true` and `false` to enable or disable monitoring of that specific ingress.

#### Configuring

First of all you need to modify `configmap.yaml`'s `config.yaml` file. Following are the available options that you can use to customize the controller:

| Key                   |Description                                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| providers             | An array of uptime providers that you want to add to your controller          |
| enableMonitorDeletion | A safeguard flag that is used to enable or disable monitor deletion on ingress deletion (Useful for prod environments where you don't want to remove monitor on ingress deletion) |

For the list of providers, there's a number of options that you need to specify. The table below lists them:

| Key           | Description                                                               |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name          | Name of the provider (From the list of supported uptime checkers)         |
| apiKey        | ApiKey of the provider                                                    |
| apiURL        | Base url of the ApiProvider                                               |
| alertContacts | A `-` separated list of contact id's that you want to add to the monitors |

*Note:* Follow [this](https://github.com/stakater/IngressMonitorController/blob/master/docs/fetching-alert-contacts-from-uptime-robot.md) guide to see how to fetch `alertContacts` from UpTimeRobot

Currently additional pingdom configurations can be added through a set of annotations to each ingress object, the current supported annotations are:
- monitor.stakater.com/pingdom-resolution # The pingdom check interval in minutes
- monitor.stakater.com/pingdom-send-notification-when-down # How many failed check attempts before notifying
- monitor.stakater.com/pingdom-paused # set to "true" to pause checks
- monitor.stakater.com/pingdom-notify-when-back-up # Set to "false" to disable recovery notifications
- monitor.stakater.com/pingdom-user-ids # string formatted array of integer user IDs to send notifications to
                                        # ie. "[123456, 654321]"

#### Deploying

You can deploy the controller in the namespace you want to monitor by running the following kubectl commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml -n <namespace>
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml -n <namespace>
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n <namespace>
```

*Note*: Before applying rbac.yaml, You need to modify the namespace in the `RoleBinding` subjects section to the namespace you want to apply rbac.yaml to.

### Helm Charts

Or alternatively if you configured `helm` on your cluster, you can deploy the controller via helm chart located under `kubernetes/chart` folder.

## Adding support for a new Monitor

You can easily implement a new monitor and use it via the controller. First of all, you will need to create a new service struct that implements the following monitor service interface

```go
type MonitorService interface {
    GetAll() []Monitor
    Add(m Monitor)
    Update(m Monitor)
    GetByName(name string) (*Monitor, error)
    Remove(m Monitor)
    Setup(apiKey string, url string, alertContacts string)
}
```

Once the implementation of your service is done, you have to open up `monitor-proxy.go` and add a new case inside `OfType` method for your new monitor. Lets say you have named your service `MyNewMonitorService`, then you have to add the case like in the example below:

```go
func (mp *MonitorServiceProxy) OfType(mType string) MonitorServiceProxy {
    mp.monitorType = mType
    switch mType {
    case "UptimeRobot":
        mp.monitor = &UpTimeMonitorService{}
    case "MyNewMonitor":
        mp.monitor = &MyNewMonitorService{}
    default:
        log.Panic("No such provider found")
    }
    return *mp
}
```

Note that the name you specify here for the case will be the key for your new monitor which you can add it in ConfigMap.

Also in case of handling custom api objects for the monitor api, you can create mappers that map from the api objects to the generic `Monitor` objects. The way you have to create these is to create a file named `monitorname-mappers.go` and add mapping functions in that file. An example of a mapping function is found below:

```go
func UptimeMonitorMonitorToBaseMonitorMapper(uptimeMonitor UptimeMonitorMonitor) *Monitor {
    var m Monitor

    m.name = uptimeMonitor.FriendlyName
    m.url = uptimeMonitor.URL
    m.id = strconv.Itoa(uptimeMonitor.ID)

    return &m
}
```
